Question 1
a. Describe the general steps required to create and use a loadable kernel module.
    Answer: First of all the functions for the device operations structure, and the ones required by 
    it are written down. this includes the init and exit fuctions that register and unregister 
    the module / device driver, set up and clear up both request queue and parameters (used for
    I/O operations), and for the interript line (and its handler). Once the code is writen the 
    code is compiled, a .ko file is created in the current directory, that will be loaded into 
    the kernel using the insmod command (and rmmod to unload)

b. Describe what a runlevel is in Linux. Additionally, describe how they are used (with
specific examples) in Linux.
    Answer: A runlevel is a mode of operation (out of the seven) that defines the state of init and
    the system after turning on. For example runlevel 1, which is Single user mode allows the computer to boot
    into a single superuser (usually the admin)

c. Create a sed command for finding occurrences of four consecutive and identical word
characters (like aaaa or bbbb)
    Answer: sed 's/\b([:alpha:]\1\1\1)//g'

d. Specifically describe the use of the following bash script
    Answer: All of the following happens from the input stream of the second command entered with the execution 
    of this script (3rd). So; in the input stream, any punctuation symbols are removed, the word containing the 
    first command (2nd after the bash script), and it is replaced with the word "@". Then removes all alphanumer
    -ic characters, collapses spaces in between words, and removes any lines that begin with '^' character. The
    output of this is directed into another sed command which replaces all occurrences of the newline character
    '\n' with spaces. This output is redirected to another sed command which removes all occurences of the string
    "@$" and replaces any '@' characters with a new line character. The output is redirected to a file named temp.
    
    Then, removes all lines starting with '$', also replaces all new line characters with a space, then search For
    a "'('<any character><any number of closed braket ')'> <-followed by a space" and replaces that with any 
    integer  followed by a space and the "$2" string from redirected output when the stream editor sed was set as 
    a file.
