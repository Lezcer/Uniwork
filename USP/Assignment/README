Behaviour
The linked list will be used to store information about the processes to be run. 
These names and arguments of these processes are stored in theinputfile described in usage. 
The number of these processes should not be constrained.
Once the linked list has been populated with process information, the processes should be
executed in sequence.
The program will iterate through the linked list;for each node it should:
- Create a new process via fork()
- Use the child process to execute the process indicated by the current node
- Store the output from the child process
- Use the output from the child process as input to the next node

Usage
./pipesim                         - This will be displayed
./pipesim inputfile               - This is going to go through 
                                    said commands and the output 
                                    will be displayed on the screen
./pipesim inputfile outputfile    - This is going to go through 
                                    said commands and the output 
                                    will be redirected to the 
                                    specified outputfile
