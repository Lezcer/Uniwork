Write a paragraph discussing the results in terms of complexity 
and other characteristics of the three sorts.
______________________________________________________________

The Insertion sort is more efficient by having a smaller 
runtime compared to the other two sorts. (7 out of 8)
This is because it is finding a place to insert each element
which is good for really large data sizes.

Bubble sort just switches around an element when the one 
before it is larger. This is very inefficient for nearly
sorted lists and this was evident in the 100000 data size 
bubble sort nearly... test. Even though the data was 90% 
sorted the runtime was ~4x as long as second place.

Selection sort looks for the smallest element and swaps it 
with the first item. This 'swapping' is what causes it to be 
slow. It has a similar complexity to Bubble sort. and this is
because they both seem to 'swap' instead of shifting like
Insertion.
