1. 
A)  "--- -23 +46---"
B)  "x= 1.230, y=216.000"

2.
A) scanf("%s %s", lword1, lword2)
B) scanf("%d:%d:%d %s", hours, minutes, seconds, ampm)
C) scanf("%c%d° %d' %f" %c%d° %d' %f", ns_deg, ns_min, ns_sec, we_deg, we_min, we_sec)

3.
A)  using fgets().  first parameter is the string you want to store the integers.
    second is the maximum characters you want to read i.e. the size of your array -1.
    (199 - 1) And last is the input stream pointer.
B)  Both of them read the same file and return 100 characters, however for fgets() if 
    the line ends before the array is filled it will just simply return that, thus 
    fgets() is designed for a line, whilst fscanf() reads the first 100 characters.
C)  you look for the \n character? then create an array of that length to store the 
    line.
