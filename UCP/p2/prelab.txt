1.  a) Inserts the content of a standard (pre-defined) header file.
    b) Inserts the content of the header files in the current directory.
    c) Assigns a name to a constant value and replaces the name with that value
       when called.
    d) Assigns a name with a parameter to an expression and repalces the name 
       with that expression when called.
    e) same as above.
    f) Will only compile the code between the directives if LENGTH has been 
       defined above. can also be triggered by the compile command.
    g) 

2.  a) ls *Ralph*
    b) ls codes/[0-9][0-9]-[a-z][a-z][a-z]
    c) ls *[^aeiou]/*[aeiou].
    d) alias listc='ls *.c'
    e) alias gcc='gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic -Werror'

3.  a) They are accessible by all functions and possibly accros different sour-
       ce files. Which allows them to change it's value - creating a mess.
    b) Point of using a static function is so that it cannot be accessed elsew-
       here, declaring it in a header file copies the code into the file that 
       calls it which makes it accessible.
    
4.  a) main.c includes database.h -> util.h -> nothing
    b) util.h includes nothing
    c) main.o databse.o util.o interface.o
    d) database.o main.o
    e) database.o util.o interface.o main.o
    f) util.o
